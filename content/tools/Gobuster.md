## Pre-made commands
##### Look for common extensions
```shell
gobuster dir -u 192.168.233.197 -x txt,pdf,bak,php,html,js,asp,aspx,png,jpg,jpeg,gif,bmp,log -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-small.txt
```


Look for these:
- .txt and .pdf files most of the time
- If its a Linux box, add .php to the list
- if its a Windows box, add .asp to the list
Then decide if you need to include .doc, .docx, .aspx, .xls, .xlsx, .rtf, .bak as they have all been used on
